âœŒ Hi there! :v: It's my (@xepozz) first post :1st_place_medal:

[The blog](https://xepozz.github.io/blogit) is started.

At now posts may interpreter any _markdown_ entities. We can see these in the next posts.

There is some highlighted snippets:
```php
class User extends \UserInterface
{
    private int $id;
}
```
```javascript
const result = [].push('one').push('two');
console.log(result);
```

```bash
ps -aux | grep init > /dev/null
```
Stay **likes**, do **reposts**, click on **bells** and all links will be in the **description** :grinning:

See ya!
